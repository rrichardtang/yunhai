# SessionStart hook: syncs rrichardtang/claude-config's agents (bob-the-builder,
# felix-the-fixer), skills (caveman), and a marked block in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# via its install.sh. That write is user-global and outlives this session — it
# applies to every project on the machine, not just this one — but it does not
# touch ~/.claude/settings.json, so it can't clobber this repo's own hook
# wiring. Nothing here spawns an agent or turns a skill on; see that repo's
# CLAUDE.md for the (opt-in) usage protocol.
